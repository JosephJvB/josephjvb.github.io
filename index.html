  Debut in 2017 writing html on codepen.io for FreeCodeCamp: https://codepen.io/ayoitsjoe/
  Took the Dev Academy bootcamp in June 2017 in Wellington, New Zealand.
  Started contracting as a Web developer for Minded on Waitangi day, 2018
  Minded was acquired, and I was offered full time employment by the buyer, Joy Business Academy in late 2018
  End of Jan 2019 I moved to Auckland to continue working for JBA on-site
  Joined MILKBooks mid COVID lockdown in 2020 after a collegue from JBA recommended me for a role and I was approached with a job offer.
  Moved to the UK with my girlfriend in 2022 for travel, work and general overseas experience.

  I thought I was going to be a lawyer!

<!--
  Im keen to do some quality learning time in the near future, 2020.
  Maybe JBA will offer me the chance to become Azure Cloud Accredited, else I find my own choice somewhere.
  Parents still strongly encourage a University Degree, and for good reason.
